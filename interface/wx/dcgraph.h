    @class wxGCDC

    wxGCDC is a device context that draws on a wxGraphicsContext.

    wxGCDC does its best to implement wxDC API, but the following features are
    not (fully) implemented because wxGraphicsContext doesn't support them:

    - GetPixel() method is not implemented and always returns @false because
      modern graphics layers don't support retrieving the contents of the drawn
      pixels.

    - FloodFill() method is not, and can't be, implemented, as its
      functionality relies on reading the pixels from wxGraphicsContext too.

    - SetLogicalFunction() method only works with @c wxCOPY, @c wxOR,
      @c wxNO_OP, @c wxCLEAR and @c wxXOR functions, attempts to use any other
      function (including @c wxINVERT) don't do anything.

    - Similarly, ::wxRasterOperationMode parameter of Blit() and StretchBlit()
      can only be one of the supported logical functions listed above, using
      any other function will result in an assertion failure and not drawing
      anything.

    - For Direct2D-based wxGraphicsContext, only true-type fonts can be used
      in the font-related functions.
